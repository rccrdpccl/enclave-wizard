# Contributing to Enclave Wizard

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Go | 1.22+ | `go version` |
| Node | 22 | **Not installed on host** — use `distrobox enter osac` for all Node/yarn/tsc commands |
| Podman (or Docker) | latest | Used for UI builds, RPM packaging, and container-based cross-compilation |
| make | any | GNU Make |

## Running Locally

All three modes serve the wizard at `https://localhost:3443`.

### Demo mode (recorded ansible-runner replay)

```bash
make demo
```

Builds with the `dev` tag, starts with `--demo-deploy` serving a pre-recorded deployment. Background process; stop with `make demo-stop`. Tune speed with `SPEED=10`.

### Dev mode (no auth, enclave-mock)

```bash
make dev
```

Builds with the `dev` tag, runs against `enclave-mock/` with `--no-auth`. Generates self-signed TLS certs if missing. Foreground process — Ctrl-C to stop.

### Real mode (needs real enclave directory)

```bash
make run
```

Builds the UI and Go binary, runs against `../enclave`. Requires a real enclave directory with schemas, playbooks, and config.

## Running Tests

### Go unit tests

```bash
make test
# or
go test ./...
```

### UI unit tests

Node is not available on the host. Use distrobox:

```bash
distrobox enter osac
cd ui
yarn install
yarn workspace @enclave-wizard-ui/wizard test
```

### E2E tests (API-level, against a remote host)

```bash
# Full run: build RPM, deploy to VM, run tests
make e2e TARGET=root@myhost

# Rerun tests without redeploying
make e2e-rerun TARGET=root@myhost

# Browser-based UI tests (Playwright)
make e2e-browser WIZARD_URL=https://myhost:3443
```

## Building

```bash
make build          # Build UI + Go binary (host arch)
make build-linux    # Cross-compile for linux/amd64 in a container
make rpm            # Build RPM package (calls build-linux)
```

## Deploying

```bash
make deploy TARGET=root@myhost            # Deploy with auth
make deploy TARGET=root@myhost AUTH=none   # Deploy without auth
```

See [deployment.md](deployment.md) for details on the RPM structure, systemd service, and VM provisioning.
