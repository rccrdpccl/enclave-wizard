# Development Workflow

## Quick Reference

```
make help           # see all available targets
make demo           # build + start demo in background (one command)
make demo-stop      # stop the demo
make demo-restart   # restart the demo
make test           # run Go tests
make build          # build UI + Go binary
make lint           # run go vet
```

## Demo Environment

The demo environment runs the wizard with fake deploy/validation backends (recorded ansible runs replayed at 10x speed) and no authentication. Ideal for UI development and manual testing.

### Start

```bash
make demo
```

This builds the UI (vite), builds the Go binary with the `dev` tag (enables demo/recording features), and starts the server in the background on `https://localhost:3443`.

### Stop

```bash
make demo-stop
```

### Customize

Environment variables control the demo:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPEED` | `10` | Replay speed multiplier (0=instant, 1=real-time) |
| `PORT` | `3443` | HTTPS port |
| `ENCLAVE_DIR` | `hack/enclave` | Enclave directory path |

Example: `SPEED=0 PORT=4443 make demo`

### How it works

- `hack/demo-start.sh` — starts the wizard in background, writes PID to `/tmp/enclave-wizard-demo.pid`, waits for health check
- `hack/demo-stop.sh` — reads PID file, kills the process, cleans up
- Logs go to `/tmp/enclave-wizard-demo.log`
- TLS certs are auto-generated if missing (`hack/tls/`)
- Demo recordings live in `fixtures/recordings/`
- Experience definitions live in `hack/enclave/experiences/`

## Building

### Full build (UI + backend)

```bash
make build
```

The UI is embedded in the Go binary at build time via `//go:embed`. Changing UI code requires rebuilding both.

### Backend only (Go changes)

```bash
go build -tags dev -o enclave-wizard .
```

Skip `build-ui` when only Go code changed. Use `dev` tag if you need demo/recording features.

### Linux cross-compile (for deployment)

```bash
make build-linux
```

Builds inside a container for linux/amd64. Used by `make rpm` and `make deploy`.

## Testing

### Go tests

```bash
make test                  # all tests with coverage
go test ./internal/api/... # specific package
go test -race ./...        # with race detector
```

### Frontend tests

Run inside a container (no Node.js on host):

```bash
# Via the UI Makefile
cd ui && make test

# Or directly
distrobox enter osac -- bash -c "cd ui && podman run --rm -v \$(pwd):/app:z -w /app node:22-alpine sh -c 'corepack enable && yarn install && yarn workspace @enclave-wizard-ui/wizard test'"
```

### TypeScript check

```bash
distrobox enter osac -- bash -c "cd ui && podman run --rm -v \$(pwd):/app:z -w /app node:22-alpine sh -c 'corepack enable && yarn install && yarn workspace @enclave-wizard-ui/wizard run -T tsc --noEmit'"
```

## Key Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `internal/runner/` | Runner interface + implementations (ansible, replay, recording) |
| `internal/deploy/` | Deployment orchestrator + persistent state |
| `internal/api/` | HTTP handlers (huma framework) |
| `internal/experience/` | Experience loader from YAML |
| `internal/config/` | Config reader/writer (YAML I/O) |
| `ui/apps/wizard/src/` | React frontend (PatternFly 6) |
| `ui/apps/wizard/src/wizard/contexts/` | Split state management (Config, Nav, Catalog) |
| `ui/apps/wizard/src/wizard/hooks/` | Extracted hooks (init, substeps, validation, navigation) |
| `ui/apps/wizard/src/api/` | API hooks (useDeployment, useSSE, useFileUpload, usePluginSchema) |
| `hack/enclave/` | Local enclave dir for demo mode |
| `fixtures/recordings/` | Recorded ansible runs for demo replay |

## Common Tasks

### After modifying a Go file

```bash
make demo-restart    # if demo is running
# or
make test            # run tests first
```

### After modifying a UI file

```bash
make demo            # rebuilds UI + binary + restarts
```

### After modifying both

```bash
make demo            # handles everything
```

### Running the real wizard (not demo)

```bash
make run             # requires ../enclave directory with real ansible playbooks
```

## Notes

- Go and Node.js run inside `distrobox enter osac` — they're not installed on the host
- The `dev` build tag enables demo/recording runner modes; production builds omit them
- `--no-auth` skips bearer token checks but the login screen still appears in the UI (use any password shown at startup)
- Config validation requires `ansible-runner` which is only available in the real enclave environment
